## Focus Area and Period

Lower Republican and Tri-Basin NRDs observed for 2008 through 2012 (9 inches per year for 5 years, 45 inches total)

```


## Research Question

+ Did agricultural producers reduce groundwater use in response to the allocation limit of 9 inches per acre during the 2008-2012 period? If so, how much?
+ What factors affect the impact of the allocation limit on groundwater use (e.g., precipitation)? 

## Data

Observational unit: well ( wells in total)
Temporal resolution: annual

### Variables
+ groundwater use 
+ treatment status: 1 if in LRNRD
+ weather
  - precipitation
  - evapotranspiration
  - GDD
+ soil characteristics
  - silt, clay, sand percentage
  - available water capacity
  - saturated hydraulic conductivity

## Strategy 

Compare groundwater use of the two groups.

+ Control group: wells in Tri-Basin NRD
+ Treatment group: wells in Lower Republican NRD


## Results

## Conclusions

## Extension
