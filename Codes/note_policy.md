# Groundwater allocation policy in the Republican River Basin in NE

+ Tri-Basin (TB) NRD (control) vs Lower Republican (LR) NRD (treatment)

## LR
+ *multi-year allocations*, with allocation 
	* period 1: 2005 - 2007: 
	* period 2: 2008 - 2012 (use this periods)
	* period 3: 2013 - 2017

+ Due to the data availability, we focus on the years of 2007-2015
+ 2007: LR-east 11 inches
+ 2007: LR-west 12 inches

+ 2008-2015: LR 9 inches (*includes allocation period 2 and 3*)


+ All the regulating NRDs (the LR, MR, and UR) allow some type of *carryover banking*, where someone who does not use his full allocation can save the remainder (or a portion of the remainder) for the next periods.
	* The LR and MR carryover rules have not changed over the study period
	* the UR did not have any limit on carryover until 2013. The new rule started from 2013 says that once ....

+ Farmers can also effectively borrow from subsequent periods in all three NRDs. 

+ **NOTE**: Don't confuse *allocation periods* with *regulation stages*
